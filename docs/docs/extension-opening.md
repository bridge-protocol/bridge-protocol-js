When the extension is opened, the user will have an option to create a new passport or to import a previously created and exported passport.

### Creating a Passport

To create a new passport, the user simply needs to create a password that is used to encrypt and decrypt the private keys and information contained in the passport.

Optionally, if the user already has a NEO or Ethereum blockchain wallet they would like to include in their Bridge Passport, the wallets can be imported by expanding the dropdown and providing the private keys to those wallets.

### Importing a Passport

If a user has an existing Bridge Passport that was previously exported, they simply select the exported .json file of the passport and provide the password that was used when the passport was created.
