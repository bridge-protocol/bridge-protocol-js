# Bridge Verified Claims
Bridge Verified Claims add a layer of trust since they add the requirement of being issued by a known Bridge Marketplace provider. Bridge Network Partners can verify the signature and retrieve the issuing passport information to ensure it was issued by a trusted entity with good standing on the network.  Only Bridge Verified Claims may be written to on-chain blockchain storage.
