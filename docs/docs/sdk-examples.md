### Creating Signed and Encrypted Claim Packages
<p class="nobottommargin">
For Bridge verification partners or for third parties wishing to issue their own signed claims for other passports, this example demonstrates how to create a claim and create signed and encrypted claim packages for transmission to the target passport. Note: Only claims issued by Bridge verification partners with known claim types are considered Bridge Verified Claims.

### Passport to Passport Claims Import
<p class="nobottommargin">
Once secure claim packages are created, they need to be transmitted to the target passport and the target passport must import those claims so they can be included in the passport.  This example demonstrates how to create a claims import request from the claims issuing passport and send it to a target passport that will then verify the request and included claims and import those claims to the passport.

### Passport to Passport Payments
<p class="nobottommargin">
When a passport wants to request payment in BRDG a request needs to be made for the receiving passport to send payment via blockchain that needs to then be validated by the requesting passport that it was sent and that the transaction completed successfully.  This example demonstrates the payment request workflow to request and send payment between two passports.
