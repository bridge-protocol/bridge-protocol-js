When a blockchain wallet is expanded, all details of the wallet are shown including the Bridge Token balance, the GAS / ETH balance and the address.  From this interface the user can click to view the previous transactions for the wallet, launch the token swap request dialog to do a cross-chain token swap, and view the private key.
