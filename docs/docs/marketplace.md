The Bridge Marketplace is an area of the Bridge Network thatallows users to find trusted verification partners on the Bridge Network.  Marketplace partners can verify user information and provide verified claims in exchange for payment in Bridge Token (BRDG).  The standard identity verification provider on the network is the Bridge Protocol Corporation provider that has capabilities to verify user identity to satisfy current international KYC and AML compliance requirements.

It is important to note that the Bridge Network manages the lifecycle of the transmission of the verification request to the verification partner only.  Any transmission of personal data and resulting verified claims between the user and marketplace verification partner are done directly without Bridge Network involvement.
