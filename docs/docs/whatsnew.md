We are pleased to release Bridge Portable Digital Identity Solution v3.0 to the community.  This release has several subtantial and exciting updates that will offer easier integration options, deeper blockchain functionality, and a superior user experience.

### Added Ethereum Support
The Bridge Protocol Keyserver smart contracts and Bridge Token are now fully supported on both the NEO and Ethereum blockchain networks.  The Bridge Token is now expressed as a hybrid chain token, and can be seamlessly swapped cross-chain using the Bridge Passport.  Users and dApps now have the ability to take full advantage of the power and security of Bridge Protocol Portable Digital Identity and enable payments with Bridge Token on either blockchain network.

### New Core SDK and Integration Microservices
The Bridge SDK and microservices were restructured to make integration of the Bridge Protocol and Bridge Network easier.  We have improved the structure, added more tests, and added more sample code around the most common use cases to make it easier than ever before for developers to integrate the Bridge Protocol into their applications.

### Redesigned Bridge Passport Browser Extension
The Bridge Extension user interface has been redesigned for more natural interactions with web applications.  The user interface was rethought and immplemented using Vue for a more robust experience for end users and enabled the extension to be more easily maintained and extended with new functionality in the future.

### Updated Bridge Network Explorer
The Bridge Network Explorer was also redesigned and extended to handle the expanded functionality of the Bridge Network.  Aside from a facelift and mobile fixes, the explorer now also reflects the blockchain distribution of the hybrid Bridge Token across both the NEO and Ethereum blockchain networks.

### Serverless Bridge Network and Marketplace Infrastructure
We've made substantial upgrades to the underlying Bridge Network and Bridge Marketplace infrastructure to enhance performance and offer a more cost effective and resilient network by leveraging serverless technology.
