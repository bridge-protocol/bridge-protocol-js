We are pleased to release Bridge Digital Identity v3.0 to the community.  This release has several subtantial and exciting updates that will offer easier integration options, deeper blockchain functionality, and a superior user experience.

### Cross-Chain Bridge Token and Smart ContractÂ Support

A major feature of version 3.0 is full support for both the NEO and the Ethereum blockchain networks.  Bridge Token and Bridge Identity are now both available on NEO and Ethereum. The token was initially available on NEO as a NEP-5 token, but with this release, the token is also on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token. The cross-chain token and smart contract support enables ecosystem projects on either chain to take full advantage of BRDG payments and on-chain Bridge Identity in their blockchain applications.

### Updated Bridge Network Explorer

The Bridge Network Explorer was also redesigned and extended to handle the expanded functionality of the Bridge Network.  Aside from a facelift and mobile fixes, the explorer now also reflects the blockchain distribution of the hybrid Bridge Token across both the NEO and Ethereum blockchain networks.

### Redesigned Bridge Passport Browser Extension

The Bridge Passport Browser Extension user interface was rethought and rebuilt from the ground up with usability and extensibility in mind.  The user interface was rewritten to take advantage of the Vue.js framework for a more robust user experience, while also enabling the extension to be more easily maintained and extended with new functionality in the future.

### New Core SDK and Integration Microservices
The Bridge SDK and microservices were restructured to make integration of the Bridge Protocol and Bridge Network easier.  We have improved the structure, added more tests, and added more sample code around the most common use cases to make it easier than ever before for developers to integrate the Bridge Protocol into their applications.





### Serverless Bridge Network and Marketplace Infrastructure
We've made substantial upgrades to the underlying Bridge Network and Bridge Marketplace infrastructure to enhance performance and offer a more cost effective and resilient network by leveraging serverless technology.
