We are pleased to release Bridge Protocol Portable Digital Identity Solution v3.0 to the community.  This release has several subtantial and exciting updates that will offer easier integration options, deeper blockchain functionality, and a superior user experience.

### Ethereum Support (beta)
The Bridge Protocol Keyserver smart contracts and Bridge Token are now fully supported on both the NEO and Ethereum blockchain networks.  The Bridge Token is now a hybrid chain token, and can be seamlessly swapped cross-chain to give users and dApps the ability to take full advantage of the Bridge Protocol and enable payments with Bridge Token on either blockchain network.

### New Core SDK and Integration Microservices
Rewritten and restructured core SDK and integration microservices to make development and integration of the Bridge Protocol and Bridge Network easier than ever before.  We have added even more sample code and integration wrappers to make it simple for developers to integrate the Bridge Protocol into their applications.

### Bridge Passport Browser Extension
The Bridge Extension user interface has been redesigned for more natural interactions with web applications.  The user interface was rethought and immplemented using Vue.js for a more robust experience for end users and added abilityt to be easily extended in future releases.

### Bridge Network Explorer
The Bridge Network Explorer was also redesigned and extended to handle the expanded functionality of the Bridge Network.  Aside from a facelift and mobile fixes, the explorer now also reflects the blockchain distribution of the hybrid Bridge Token across both the NEO and Ethereum blockchain networks.

### Bridge Network and Marketplace Infrastructure
We've made substantial upgrades to the underlying Bridge Network and Bridge Marketplace infrastructure to enhance performance and offer a more cost effective and resilient network by leveraging serverless technology.
