The marketplace request create dialog allows the user to create a new marketplace request to verify their information with a Bridge Marketplace partner.

The user will use the dropdown to select the partner they wish to use to verify their information, and an information link will be provided to view the selected partner's Bridge Marketplace landing page.  The landing page will display any services and fees offered by the Bridge Marketplace partner.

If the user wishes to use the partner, they simply select the blockchain network they wish to send the Bridge Token payment on to cover the network fees, and create the request. 

**NOTE:** Bridge Network fees are separate from the fees for service that may be charged by a Bridge Marketplace Partner.  Be sure to review the services, pricing, and terms of service before selecting a provider.  Bridge Network fees are non refundable.
