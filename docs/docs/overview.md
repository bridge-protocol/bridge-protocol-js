The Bridge Protocol was designed to provide users with a verified portable digital identity they could use to provide the information they choose to third parties online, via blockchain networks, and even in real-world transactions via hardware.

## Secure Digital Identity
Bridge Protocol is a secure identity protocol that allows for verification, management, and transmission of digital identity. With the Bridge Protocol, users are in total control of their data and only provide the data they choose.

## Flexible Integration Options
Your Bridge Protocol identity is fully portable allowing for peer-to-peer, in-person, and on-chain transmission with popular blockchains. There are several flexible integrated authentication and authorization options for any application.

## Open Source
Bridge Protocol was built and open sourced to bring secure digital identity to the community. The core SDK, integration microservices, and end-user clients are all available on GitHub and free to use in all of your applications.
