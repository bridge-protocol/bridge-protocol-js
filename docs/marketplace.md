The Bridge Marketplace allows users to find trusted verification partners on the Bridge Network via a public API.  The standard identity verification provider on the network is the Bridge Protocol Corporation verificaiton provider to verify identity that satisfies KYC and AML compliance requirements.  The Bridge Network manages the lifecycle of the transmission of the verification request to the verification partner only.  Any transmission of personal data and resulting verified claims between the user and verification partner are done directly without Bridge Network involvement.
